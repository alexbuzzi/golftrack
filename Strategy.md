# General stratagy:
#  - Detect ball being struck
#  - After struck start recording accelerometer data
#  - Detect ball coming to a stop (accel< some value)
#  - Send out radio signal from phone to turn on switch
#  - Switch will connect battery to coil to turn on active RFID chip
#  - Either accelerometer data will be streamed or onboard calculations will take place in microprocessor and then be streamed
#  -

# - Considerations: Power draw, cost, size, weight distribution
